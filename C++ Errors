--------------------------------
Compile-time Errors
--------------------------------
Two types of compile-time errors:

        Syntax Errors
        
                -> Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax. 
                
        Type Errors
        
                -> Errros that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared. 


                        -> Most common errors here are the semi-colon <-

-------------------
Link-time Errors
-------------------
-> Link-time errors are found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable file.

               ->  Most common errors here are the main(). <-



--------------------
Run-time Errors 
--------------------
-> Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time errors and link-time errors asks the computer to do
   something that the computer is unable to reliably do. 
   
                
                        -> Errors usually found in the operations such as division, multiplication, etc.. <-


------------------
Logic Errors
------------------
-> Logical errors are a type of error which provide incorrect output, but appears to be error-free.


                        -> Usually found in the logic of the code. <-
